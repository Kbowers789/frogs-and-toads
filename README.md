# Frogs &amp; Toads Puzzle
A basic Javascript and HTML/CSS version of the classic Frogs &amp; Toads puzzle.

The puzzle's goal is to move all the frogs on one side of the board to the opposite side, and same for the toads.

The rules for moveing the frogs and toads are very simple:
1. A frog/toad can only move forward, and never backwards.
2. A frog/toad can move one space forward if the space is empty.
3. A frog/toad can hop two spaces forward ONLY if the space in front is occupied by the opposite type, and the target space is unoccupied.
